			His Highness grew up with a deep-rooted love for his country and was able to expand his knowledge through broad education.

			On 25th January 1972, 9th Dhi Al-Hijja 1391 (Arafa Day) His Highness Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi became the Ruler of Sharjah after its former ruler, Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, was assassinated in an attempted coup by loyalists of Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi.
